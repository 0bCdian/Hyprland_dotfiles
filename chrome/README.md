### Compatibility
> This release was tested on the following platforms (only supports Firefox 70+):
> - Windows 10 (Home, Pro, Enterprise, LTSB, LTSC and Education)
> - Untested on macOS and Linux. This doesn't mean it won't work on these Operating Systems, this just means it isn't tested yet. If you want to contribute, please test it on any of these and fill in an issue with the distro you use or the macOS version it was tested on, and obviously the results.

#### Note about Automated Installation
> We're working on an automated script to install the theme. It will be available on the Releases tab as soon as we finish it.

### Manual Installation Steps
> Copy the files to the `chrome` folder in your Firefox Profile directory. Here are the detailed install steps:
> 1. Go to `about:support` in Firefox.
> 2. Search for Application Basics, find Profile Directory and click on Open Directory.
> 3. Copy the files mentioned above into the `chrome` folder from the Profile directory (usually has `-release` at the end, and you should create the `chrome` folder if it doesn't already exist).
> 4. This step is crucial. If you do it wrong, you can brick your Firefox installation.
>     1. Go to `about:config` in Firefox.
>     2. Search for `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set it to `true` by clicking on the arrow button.
> 5. Restart Firefox.
> 6. You're done!
